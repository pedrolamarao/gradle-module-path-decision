= gradle-module-path-decision

This simple project should respond to `./gradlew run` with `Hello World!`.

Instead, it raises `NoSuchElementException`.

The cause is Gradle's decision to put `api` and `impl` in the class path instead of the module path.
Gradle seems to make this decision based on the fact that `app` is not a module.

This decision breaks the service loader mechanism.
`impl` declares it's provided services in its module definition.
It is meant to be put in the module path, not the class path.

One may be tempted to avoid this problem by redeclaring `impl` 's services in `META-INF/services`.
This way, when `impl` be put in the class path, the service loader is satisfied.

However, `api` module designers intended for the `spi` package to have restricted access to `impl` only.
Allowing `api` and `impl` in the class path makes this restriction meaningless.
To enforce this restriction, `api` and `impl` must require the module path.

Currently, one cannot apply this kind of architecture with non-modular Gradle applications.
